/**
 * DesignLab.jsx
 * ─────────────
 * Thin wrapper around the Design App that:
 *  1. Accepts `initialDesignId` from the exam session store so returning
 *     to this question reloads the student's saved canvas from the DB
 *     instead of creating a blank new one every time.
 *  2. Calls `onDesignCreated(id)` once when the design is first created
 *     so the parent can persist the ID in the answer store.
 *  3. On submit, the design will be exported and uploaded to Cloudinary
 *     automatically by the student exam session handler.
